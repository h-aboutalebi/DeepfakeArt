# DeepfakeArt Dataset
Introducing the premier dataset designed to encompass various forgery generation techniques derived from original source images. This dataset is specifically crafted to aid in the detection of copyright infringement in generative computer vision models. Boasting over 30,000 records, each entry consists of a pair of images that are either similar (wherein the generated image infringes upon the copyright of the original image) or dissimilar.

The forgery creation methods implemented in this dataset include:

- Inpainting
- Style Transfer
- Adversarial 
- Segmix
- Cutmix
