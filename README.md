# DeepfakeArt Dataset
Introducing the premier dataset designed to encompass various forgery generation techniques derived from original source images. This dataset is specifically crafted to aid in the detection of copyright infringement in generative computer vision models. Boasting over 30,000 records, each entry consists of a pair of images that are either similar (wherein the generated image infringes upon the copyright of the original image) or dissimilar.

The forgery creation methods implemented in this dataset include:

- Inpainting
- Style Transfer
- Adversarial 
- Segmix
- Cutmix


**The Dataset is available [Visit Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielmao2019/deepfakeart)**

## Inpainting Category

The source dataset for this category is WikiArt [ref] (https://paperswithcode.com/paper/large-scale-classification-of-fine-art). Each image is sampled randomly from the dataset as the source image to generate forgery images. 
Each record in this category consists of three images: 

- original image: The source image used to create a forgery image from
- inpainting image: The inpainting image generated by Stable Diffusion 2 model [ref] (https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting)
- masking image: black-white image which white parts depicts which parts of original image is inpainted by Stable Diffusion 2 to generate inpainting image

This category consists of more than 5000 records.
